    <description> 
          This is the vim nightly build, the project can be found on [vim-win32-installer](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer)
          The chocolatey package repo can be found: [vim-nightly-choco](https://github.com/chantisnake/vim-nightly-choco)
          * This project may not support 32-bits any more only 64-bits machine will be supported

    <releaseNotes>Nightly Vim Windows build snapshots ([more information](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Where_to_download_Vim)).

### Changes:

* [7.4.2025](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2025) The cursor blinking stops or is irregular when receiving date over a channel and writing 
* [7.4.2024](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2024) More buf_valid() calls can be optimized. Solution: Use bufref_valid() instead.
* [7.4.2023](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2023) buflist_findname_stat() may find a dummy buffer. Solution: Set the BF_DUMMY flag after lo
* [7.4.2022](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2022) Warnings from 64 bit compiler. Solution: Add type casts. (Mike Williams)
* [7.4.2021](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2021) Still too many buf_valid() calls. Solution: Make au_new_curbuf a bufref. Use bufref_valid
* [7.4.2020](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2020) Can't build without +autocmd feature. Solution: Adjust #ifdefs.
* [7.4.2019](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2019) When ignoring case utf_fold() may consume a lot of time. Solution: Optimize for ASCII.
* [7.4.2018](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2018) buf_valid() can be slow when there are many buffers. Solution: Add bufref_valid(), only g
* [7.4.2017](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2017) When there are many errors adding them to the quickfix list takes a long time. Solution: 
* [7.4.2016](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2016) Warning from MinGW about _WIN32_WINNT redefined. (John Marriott) Solution: First undefine

Download and execute the most recent gvim_7.._x86.exe file to install Vim.
The exe file contains the (32bit) installer while the .zip files contain an
archive of the 32bit (_x86) or 64bit versions (_x64). To install it, extract
the archive and update your PATH variable. The installer will do that
automatically and provide some additional extensions (e.g. Edit with Vim menu).
The gvim...pdb.zip file only contains the corresponding pdb files for debugging the binaries.

If you need a dynamic interface to Perl, Python2, Python3, Ruby, TCL, Lua or Racket/MzScheme,
make sure you also install the following. Vim will work without it, but some Plugin
might need this additional dependency. (e.g. Gundo needs a working Pyhton2 installation,
Command-T needs a working Ruby installation and Neocomplete needs a working Lua
installation). This means, those interpreters have to be installed in addition to Vim.
Without it Vim won't be able to use that feature! You can find those interperters here:

* [ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads) 5.22
* [ActiveTcl](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads) 8.6
* [LuaBinaries](http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html) 5.3
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.4
* [Racket](https://download.racket-lang.org/) 6.4
* [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) 2.2

Make sure that you install the same architecture (32bit/64bit) that matches your Vim installation.
