    <description> 
          This is the vim nightly build, the project can be found on [vim-win32-installer](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer)
          The chocolatey package repo can be found: [vim-nightly-choco](https://github.com/chantisnake/vim-nightly-choco)
          * This project may not support 32-bits any more only 64-bits machine will be supported

### Changes:

* [7.4.2098](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2098) Text object tests are old style. Solution: Turn them into new style tests. (James McCoy, 
* [7.4.2097](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2097) Warning from 64 bit compiler. Solution: use size_t instead of int. (Mike Williams)
* [7.4.2096](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2096) Lambda functions show up with completion. Solution: Don't show lambda functions. (Ken Tak
* [7.4.2095](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2095) Man test fails when run with the GUI. Solution: Adjust for different behavior of GUI. Add
* [7.4.2094](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2094) The color allocation in X11 is overly complicated. Solution: Remove find_closest_color(),
* [7.4.2093](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v7.4.2093) Netbeans test fails once in a while. Leaving log file behind. Solution: Add it to the lis

Download and execute the most recent gvim_7.._x86.exe file to install Vim.
The exe file contains the (32bit) installer while the .zip files contain an
archive of the 32bit (_x86) or 64bit versions (_x64). To install it, extract
the archive and update your PATH variable. The installer will do that
automatically and provide some additional extensions (e.g. Edit with Vim menu).
The gvim...pdb.zip file only contains the corresponding pdb files for debugging the binaries.

If you need a dynamic interface to Perl, Python2, Python3, Ruby, TCL, Lua or Racket/MzScheme,
make sure you also install the following. Vim will work without it, but some Plugin
might need this additional dependency. (e.g. Gundo needs a working Pyhton2 installation,
Command-T needs a working Ruby installation and Neocomplete needs a working Lua
installation). This means, those interpreters have to be installed in addition to Vim.
Without it Vim won't be able to use that feature! You can find those interperters here:

* [ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads) 5.22
* [ActiveTcl](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads) 8.6
* [LuaBinaries](http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html) 5.3
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.4
* [Racket](https://download.racket-lang.org/) 6.4
* [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) 2.2

Make sure that you install the same architecture (32bit/64bit) that matches your Vim installation.
